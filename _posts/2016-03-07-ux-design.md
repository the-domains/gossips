# UX design

We can all recall a lousy experience with products and services we use in our daily lives. It's just common, unfortunately. Let's make a change - Give up the good and go for the great with us! We create an addictive, charismatic link between customer and company.

In both the physical and digital domains, Nakonari approaches the design of products and services from the perspective of what they do for people. We begin with individuals' motivations, then break down their behaviors to reconstruct them in ways that not only make sense, but also make smiles.

We take a prototype-centered approach to testable user experience design, with a customized framework of tools and methods for each project, which deliver products and services that go beyond merely usable -- to those that emotionally connect to people.

## Our secrets uncovered:

**We love making digital products & services.**  
Product Strategy, User Research, Design, Technology, Analytics & Optimization: everything you need to make a successful product or service, and nothing more.

**Research outcomes communicated well.**  
The ability to present the research outcomes in a way everyone can grasp is our mantra. In each and every project this becomes the moment when we clients get enthusiastic to become engaged.

**More prototypes, less design presentations.**  
In our experience, the biggest ideas usually come from hard work during iterative design and development.

**We're one team: You + Nakonari.**  
We ask our clients to participate directly with us in an intensely collaborative process based on specific measures of success, rapid prototyping, and continuous testing and improvement. The result is one combined team, making things the right way, with less time invested in presentations and arbitrary deliverables.

**Good products require good development.**  
The best digital products and services are made by designers and engineers working together. We're used to become a part of your team or to work as closely as possible with your external development team.
